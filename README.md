## Notes

**Examples**
Figures and example code can be deleted without affecting the functionality of the document (be sure to delete such lines of code in tau-book.tex to avoid compilation errors).

**Bibliography with external editors**
If the bibliography does not show up the first time that you run the document, try running the 'tau-book.cls' and 'tau.bib' file with biber from the MikTeX console or your preferred LaTeX distribution to generate the .aux files and (re)run tau-book.tex.
